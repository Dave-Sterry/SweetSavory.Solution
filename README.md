### A C# website by David Sterry 
Initialized on 01/08/21
Last updated on 01/008/21


## **Project Description**

This website allows the manager of a Sillystring factor to manage their machines and engineers. Machines and enigneers can be added seperately, and then assigned to each other. This was a Friday independent project for Epicodus to further my knowledge of using MySQL, join tables and many to many relationships along with CRUD functionality.  

## **User Stories**
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to see a list of all engineers, and I need to be able to see a list of all machines.
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to select a engineer, see their details, and see a list of all machines that engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to select a machine, see its details, and see a list of all engineers licensed to repair it.
* As the factory manager, I need to add new engineers to our system when they are hired. I also need to add new machines to our system when they are installed.
* As the factory manager, I should be able to add new machines even if no engineers are employed. I should also be able to add new engineers even if no machines are installed
* As the factory manager, I need to be able to add or remove machines that a specific engineer is licensed to repair. I also need to be able to modify this relationship from the other side, and add or remove engineers from a specific machine.
* I should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all engineers and machines. Users should be able to click on an individual engineer or machine to see all the engineers/machines that belong to it.

## **Installation Instructions**
### **Setup Database Connection**

AppSettings
* This project requires an AppSettings file. Create your `appsettings.json` file in the main `Factory` directory. 
* Format your `appsettings.json` file as follows including your unique password that was created at MySqlWorkbench installation:

```
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
      "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=david_sterry;uid=YourId;pwd=YourPassword;"
  }
}
```
* Update the Server, Port, and User ID as needed with your own

Import Database using Entity Framework Core
* Navigate to UniversityRegistrar.Solution/UniversityTracker and type `dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>` into the terminal
* Then, type `dotnet ef database update` into the terminal to create your database tables.


## **SQL Schema**

DB SQL Schema Snippet
* Paste this Schema Create Statement into your SQL Workbench to create this database and its tables.
```
CREATE DATABASE  IF NOT EXISTS `david_sterry` 

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `__EFMigrationsHistory`;
 SET character_set_client = utf8mb4 ;
CREATE TABLE `__EFMigrationsHistory` (
  `MigrationId` varchar(95) NOT NULL,
  `ProductVersion` varchar(32) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`MigrationId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `Engineers`;
 SET character_set_client = utf8mb4 ;
CREATE TABLE `Engineers` (
  `EngineerId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `EngineerName` longtext,
  `HireDate` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000',
  PRIMARY KEY (`EngineerId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=3 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `MachineEnigneer`;

 SET character_set_client = utf8mb4 ;
CREATE TABLE `MachineEnigneer` (
  `MachineEngineerId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `MachineId` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `EngineerId` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`MachineEngineerId`),
  KEY `IX_MachineEnigneer_EngineerId` (`EngineerId`),
  KEY `IX_MachineEnigneer_MachineId` (`MachineId`),
  CONSTRAINT `FK_MachineEnigneer_Engineers_EngineerId` FOREIGN KEY (`EngineerId`) REFERENCES `engineers` (`EngineerId`) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  CONSTRAINT `FK_MachineEnigneer_Machines_MachineId` FOREIGN KEY (`MachineId`) REFERENCES `machines` (`MachineId`) ON DELETE CASCADE
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=8 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `Machines`;
 SET character_set_client = utf8mb4 ;
CREATE TABLE `Machines` (
  `MachineId` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `MachineName` longtext,
  `InstallDate` datetime(6) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0001-01-01 00:00:00.000000',
  PRIMARY KEY (`MachineId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT=4 DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;
```
You can now type the follow code into your terminal to launch the program.

<code>dotnet run</code>

The program should launch using your default web browser at URL: localhost:5000.
